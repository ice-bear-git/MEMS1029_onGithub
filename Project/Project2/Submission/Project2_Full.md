# Project 2 Pre
This is the integrated PDF for the **What's If --- Charger**, while only the most important part would be delivered by Presentation. In other words, the slide would be a compact version of this PDF. For you better experience, we also upload the pre video onto this [Youtube channel]().  

Please following this PDF to fill/complete the [Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HYqy3v19bSerjoaMxSECdQXRpdUGOncS/edit#slide=id.g11d6fdaa502_0_31): Mainly Show Key Words and figures! Do not Copy banches of Sentence!!  
* [Yoosup Shin]  will assist Puhang Cai to finish the Slides
* [Yoosup Shin]  would do all the recording for each part --- based on this PDF and the comments of each Slides --- you would better prepare some drafts. As the finial version of the Slides will be finished by Friday 9 AM, please prepare the drafts now. Tomorrow 9AM-11AM, please do the recording, and send the audio file into GroupMe. Along with the audio recording, we would like to track how you interact with the slides--- but we won't use this interaction as the final video. We mainly looking forward to your clear audio presentation over each part of the Slides.

* A Name for the design: What's If -- Charger  
To show what's would happens if we only use classical mechanism to store the enger.   

* Will Attach an overview image of the whole assembly!
* [PUHANG CAI] --- Leave the space in Slide
* [YuMing Gu] --- prepare the overall screenshot?

## Objectives
* Our device can store 10 Watt-hours of energy.  
* We have analysis on 3 types of springs, and finally choose to use the "rotor spring". To deliver an appropriate analysis, we read Chap10-14 to equip ourself with relatant knowledges.  
* To minimize the size of the system, we seek to reduce the space for spring by find more stiff spring and utilize the parallel strcutre.  
* The focus of hand-crank design is to maxmize the torque that can be given by human, rather than the handle shape. Before it is truly productized, we can incorporate human factor considerations to make the handle grip experience better.
* We also search among the internet to reveal the best shopping resource for bunch of springs.

## Design and Analysis
1. How does our design of the device meet the criteria?  
* [MINGZHE CAI].  


2. Why did you select the gear train ans spring arrangment that you did?  
* [MINGZHE CAI].  
* Consider the torque that a human can give to the hand-crank;  
* Determine the required torque based on the specifications and overall number of the spring.  
* Figure out the required torque amplifing ratio between human input and required storing input.  
* Break down the amplifing ratio to a gear train, given a few options among the common commerical gears.  


3. Give Detailed Specifications of all design components.  
* [YUMING GU]  
* The overall dimensions
* The screenshoot.

* Gear: [Websites](), ![Figure]()
* HandCrank? [Websites](), ![Figure]()

## Feasibility

1. What steps did we take to make the device as realizable as possible?
* [PuHang Cai].  
* Figure out the required number and specification of the spring --- [This is very important!!! try to find the type of spring that can drag down the required spring number from 3600 --> 700 --> 100 --> 28]
* Make sure it makes sense in terms of the size -- Layout.  

2. State whether the client's idea is feasible and provide reasons as to why or why not?
* [ZIANG CAO]  
The only interesting part: we can have a glance of what world would be by only using classical mechaism to drive the electrical application. --- How inconvenient it is.

Infeasible:  
- Low efficiency -- in Business world
- high price.  
- Overall size is so big.   
	+ Especially for the Normal Spring?
- Although the 10 Wh is acceptable for human, it would be better to change hand-crank input to bicycle-like foot-crank input.  

## Solid Model and Engineering Drawings
* [YUMING GU]  
* 3 Parts!!!! The Hand-crank, gear box, and energy storage setup.
* Clearly Show 3 different views of the model due to its compact nature.
* Use sub-assembly views if necesary to explain the operation and components
* A video of the gear train in animation would be helpful!

## Bill of Materials
* Add a complete Bill of Materials listing all of the components used in your design, with specific vendors and part numbers wherever appropriate.
